<!--excerpt-->
I have this idea.  It's not a new one, but it's something that I want to try anyway.  I've now got a nice trail of failed bootstrapped startups in my wake.  There are a bunch of reasons that I can think of, but I can't get away from the fact that one problem has been the idea itself. I want to be more systematic about how I approach a new idea, but to also remain realistic, even dispassionate about the potential of any new venture that I get into.  The best way I can think about doing this is to throw the net wide, to build a bunch of startups, to learn what works for me.

  I have this idea.  It's not a new one, but it's something that I want to try anyway.  I've now got a nice trail of failed bootstrapped startups in my wake.  There are a bunch of reasons that I can think of, but I can't get away from the fact that one problem has been the idea itself. So now I want to be much more systematic about how I approach a new idea, but to also remain realistic, even dispassionate about the potential of any new venture that I get into.  The best way I can think about doing this is to throw the net wide, to build a bunch of startups, to learn what works for me.

So.  The rules of engagement.  Over the next few months I am going to build ten new startups.  I want each one to succeed.  I want to end up with ten thriving new businesses.  

Now I know that sounds unrealistic, of course it does.  But what I want to build is side-project style startups rather than Silicon Valley startups.  All I want to prove is that I can build some things or **something** that people want, and to bring enough monthly revenue to allow me to quit my day job - a common dream, I know.  So that's the first rule of engagement: **small ideas**.

What else?  Well I want the startups to all feel different from each other.  I want different business models, different approaches, even different disciplines.  Now of course I need to work to my strengths (more on that later but I also want this whole process to help me learn stuff and to find new stuff that I enjoy.    So that's the second rule, each idea must be substantially **different** from all other ideas.

So why this blog?  I'm going to share as much as I possibly can about this process. The approach flies in the face of common advice, and it may be misguided, but I can't shake the feeling that it might work for me. So depending on how this all turns out it might be interesting, it might be useful, it might be both and it might be neither.  Let's see..
