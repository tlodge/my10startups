Finding ten new startup ideas.  
<!--/excerpt-->

<p className="lead">
Fleshing out ten new startup ideas.  This part was (eventually) easier than I thought it would be.  I'm looking for ideas that stand a chance of bringing in a regular income. I started with an Internet search - "Startup ideas", "Great startup ideas" and so on and so forth.  I found that quite depressing and click baitey.  Next I tried Hacker News, but most of the stuff I found there was quite "grand vision" or esoteric; I needed 'lightweight' ideas - stuff that I'll be able to get up and running with reasonably quickly.  
</p>

I took a small step back and instead thought more about the types of online business that make money; basic models that have been proven to work.  That is much easier, and to my surprise, helped me to think of ideas that interest me, that don't feel too ambitious, but also look like they could, might, maybe work.

So here is the list that I have come up with.  Ten online business models, a lttle vague at the moment, but I'm happy with it as a starting point!

1.	**Widgets and Plugins.** This has always appealed to me.  Take a popular platform with a third party store of widgets, plugins, apps.  Build one that is either new and useful, or one that improves upon whatever is currently popular.  There are, as far as I can see, lots of good reasons to go down this route: there is a ready made audience, a ready made infrastructure for taking money and, quite often, lots of examples of widgets that are poorly designed but nevertheless quite popular.  I feels to me like this could be a nice low-stress way of bringing in a bit of extra money every month.  There are, of course a bunch of downsides too; you're at the mercy of the platform that you're writing code for - they can pull you, change their APIs and terms and conditions or even, if your offering proves to be very popular, simply provide an alternative.  These can also be quite crowded market places and (I suspect) there will be a lot of time spent trying to please MANY people paying small sums of money, rather than a few paying a decent sum.  But I still like it and I still think that it would be an interesting space to get into.
So I  have a bunch of TODOs:  First and foremost - do a bit of research on platforms.  Before I've done the work, I'm tempted by Shopify - it seems to promote a decent developer experience, and, because there is at least the potential for users understand the immediate impact that your plugin has on their business - it might be easier to charge a decent monthly fee.  I'll also look at website builder platforms too - just because they enjoy a huge user base; wordpress is still massive, but Squarespace and Wix seem to be popular too - as far as I know all three of these support 3rd party development.
2. **Skill for sale** This is one of those basic business ideas that I've never thought about touching in the past because it simply feels like it would be hard to get any traction in a very crowded space.  I'm a decent programmer and I love design and am getting better at it.  Is there space for another web company?  I've made a reasonable amount of money out of the odd project in the past, but I've never promoted myself as a web designer or web developer.  If I built a slick arse site that offered custom sites, mobile apps,  specialised backend functionality - would it bring in clients?  How much time, effort, money would need to be spent to be seen, to be considered to be contacted by new clients?  There's much more work that needs to be done here - I suspect I'll need a niche.  I need to find sectors that aren't all that well supported by tech yet, ones where there's a good chance of word of mouth referrals.  Do they even exist?  Am I over thinking it?
3. **Subscription (in the post) service?** I like this idea, but it's about as far away from pure software development that I'm likely to stray.  But I do think that we're still in a world where good design and software can get people like me into subscription businesses without an immediate need to have expertise in the products being sold.  I have a few ideas I'm quite excited about in this space, and I'll get to them in a later blog (yes, I'm foolish enough to think that my ideas might be good enough to get pinched)
4. **Online shop.** Let's go back to basics.  Yes I know this is the most crowded of all crowded markets, but here is the thinking; I'm not looking to build an empire.  To be honest I don't really care what I sell, but I really do care about understanding what it takes to give an online shop an online presence; or at least enough of a presence that enough people fidn it and buy things from it.  I don't like the idea of dropshipping  - or at least I like the idea but hate what it has become.  But I think, if I were to get into this space I'd just look into packaging a bunch of products together and selling them on.  My first port of call will be DIY or hardware forums; to find common problems that have relatively complex solutions and to package the tools/equipment needed to solve it.  We'll see..
5. **Agency** Jobs, dating and houses, obviously massive and untouchable.  But niche sectors are served much less well.  I've not been impressed with, for example, sites that promise to match co-founders for new startups.  It also feels to me that the legal space could benefit from decent agency software.  Take for example the plethora of problems that are faced by leaseholders and tenants in flats and apartments. Is there an opportunity here to build the site that matches specific legal issues to firms and lawyers?  TODO: find sectors, trawl forums!
6.	**Software as a Service** I know, this is so general as to be utterly useless.  I was listening to a podcast on a run a couple of days ago about a guy that founded a helpdesk solution that aggregated a bunch of live chat solutions that people could plug into their websites.  He was making 3 million a year in revenue.  When I took a look at his site I was underwhelmed and totally amazed that he made any money from it. I guess the real skill here is identifying a service that has a big enough audience.  Or maybe he just got into live chat at the right time.  I don't know.  But again, I'm looking for niche solutions in a big space.  My front runner at the moment is *presentations*.  There's a who ecosystem around online presentations; there's the desktop behemoths - Powerpoint and Keynote, and there are online services such as Prezi that seem to be getting massive numbers of users.  But I've taken a look at forums and there are some features that people are screaming for that I reckon I could take a decent stab at.  I'm actually tempted to make this my startup business number one.  Infact.  I will.  More in my next blog!
7.	**Platform** I've tried to build platforms before, with limited success.  I built a no-code platform for managing large scale residential properties. It got a reasonable amount of interest; it was used in a few properties, but that's as far as it got.  Now I'm tempted to look at blogging platforms; there are loads of brilliant options out there already; but I wonder if there are blog 'types' that aren't as well served by standard offerings. What about blogs that all users to set a goal and chart their experiences, with decent templates for recording things learnt, for charting progress, for recording mood?  Not sure if there's any money in it though.
8.	**Hardware product** I'm cheating a bit here because I don't seriously imagine any hardware project could be run as a side-project style startup.  But I do think that it might be possible to get to a very rudimentary prototype stage to demonstrate a proof-of-concept that might then inspire funding.  I'm chaeting because I've already done a bit of work here.  But at the same time, I think there's every chance this idea might drop off the list. 
9.	**Podcast** I love podcasts. I have no aptitude for creating one.  But I want to look into this some more. I'm certain that to generate any money at all, a podcast would need to be far bigger than I'd expect. I've heard enough podcasters talk about what's involved in podcast production and I know it would need an awful lot of planning and draw from a whole bunch of skills that I don't have.  I also cringe at the thought of hearing me talk about anything. Despite all of this, as I said, I love podcasts so I'm keeping it here for now. Where to find original/interesting/useful material?  God I feel naive with this one.  
10.	**Game** I'm not big of games but my two daughters are. And they've been vociferous in championing building a game on Roblox.  To be honest they came up with what, at least to me, sounded like some brilliant ideas that they thought would work.  Dunno.  Feel very very out of my depth here, but I'm keeping it on the list for now.
